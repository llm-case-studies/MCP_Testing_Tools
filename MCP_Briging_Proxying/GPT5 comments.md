Absolutely—so I extended the bridge to cover what you asked:

OpenAPI: full schema + Swagger UI at /docs (and /openapi.json).

Streaming HTML console: a lightweight live viewer at /live that streams events and lets you fire JSON-RPC requests.

Any→Any I/O: in addition to HTTP POST + SSE, there’s WebSocket (/ws?session=...) for bidirectional streaming.

Pluggable middleware: a filter chain you can toggle at runtime:

redact_secrets (on by default) masks common key/token patterns in all string fields.

add_bridge_meta (off by default) augments frames with bridge_meta (ts/direction/session) for traceability.

Toggle at runtime: POST /filters/{name} with {"enabled": true|false}; list via GET /filters.

I packaged it as a single file you can run right away:

Download stdio_gateway_v1_1.py

Quick start
pip install fastapi uvicorn pydantic
python stdio_gateway_v1_1.py --cmd "serena --stdio" --port 8080


Common flows

Create session → POST /sessions → { "session": "…" }

Listen → GET /events?session=… (SSE) or WS /ws?session=…

Send → POST /messages?session=… (JSON-RPC; id auto-assigned if omitted)

Watch live → open /live

Docs → open /docs

Drop-in “smartness”

Add or modify filters by registering a function with signature:

def my_filter(direction: str, session_id: str, message: dict) -> dict | None:
    # mutate, enrich, or return None to drop
    return message


(In the file, see the FilterChain and the two examples to copy/paste.)

Notes on “any-to-any”

You can have multiple front-ends (SSE & WS) attached to the same session, and the gateway will fan-out responses to both.

If you later want gRPC or a webhook push-out, you can add another sink in Broker._send() or a background worker that posts to external endpoints—no changes to Serena required.

If you want, I can also wire:

a /metrics endpoint (Prometheus),

request/response sampling to disk or S3,

a YAML rules engine filter (e.g., redact/allowlist based on method and JSON paths).
