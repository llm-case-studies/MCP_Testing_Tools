# MCP SSE OAuth Research Plan & Progress Tracker

## Research Objectives

1. **Document Current State:** Catalog existing MCP SSE implementations and their authentication patterns
2. **Identify Best Practices:** Find production-ready OAuth 2.1 implementations for MCP
3. **Gap Analysis:** Compare our implementation with industry standards
4. **Security Patterns:** Document secure deployment and authentication strategies
5. **Implementation Guidance:** Create actionable recommendations for production deployment

## Research Plan Phases

### Phase 1: Core Implementation Survey ‚úÖ COMPLETE
**Status:** Complete
**Findings:** Saved in `Current_MCP_Implementations_Research.md`

**Repositories Analyzed:**
- ‚úÖ `modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk` - Official Python SDK
- ‚úÖ `panz2018/fastapi_mcp_sse` - FastAPI SSE implementation  
- ‚úÖ `dgellow/mcp-front` - OAuth 2.1 proxy (‚≠ê **CRITICAL FINDING**)

**Key Discoveries:**
- MCP spec lacks standardized SSE authentication
- mcp-front provides production OAuth 2.1 proxy pattern
- Current clients cannot provide auth credentials natively

### Phase 2: Advanced Implementation Analysis üîÑ IN PROGRESS
**Status:** Partially complete (interrupted)

**Next Priority Repositories:**
1. üîÑ `ory/mcp-sse` - Ory's SSE implementation (NEXT)
2. ‚è≥ `modelcontextprotocol/servers` - Official server examples
3. ‚è≥ `RooseveltAdvisors/fastapi-mcp-client` - Client implementation patterns

### Phase 3: Production Patterns Research ‚è≥ PENDING
**Repositories to Analyze:**
- `wong2/awesome-mcp-servers` - Survey of implementations
- GitHub search for production deployments
- Authentication and security pattern analysis

### Phase 4: Gap Analysis & Recommendations ‚è≥ PENDING
**Deliverables:**
- Comparison matrix: Our implementation vs industry best practices
- Security recommendations for production deployment
- Authentication strategy recommendations
- Performance and scaling considerations

## Progress Tracking

### Research Sessions

**Session 1 - Initial Discovery**
- Date: [Current session]
- Duration: ~45 minutes
- Status: Interrupted due to context/usage limits
- Progress: Phase 1 complete, Phase 2 started
- Key Finding: dgellow/mcp-front OAuth 2.1 proxy pattern

### Interruption Recovery Plan

**If Research Gets Interrupted:**
1. **Resume Point:** Continue with ory/mcp-sse analysis
2. **Context Recovery:** Read `Current_MCP_Implementations_Research.md`
3. **Priority Order:** Follow Phase 2 repository list
4. **Documentation Strategy:** Update research files after each repository analysis

## Key Questions to Answer

### Authentication & Security
- [ ] How do production MCP implementations handle OAuth 2.1?
- [ ] What are the security best practices for SSE endpoints?
- [ ] How is session management handled across implementations?
- [ ] What are the domain restriction and access control patterns?

### Technical Implementation  
- [ ] What are the common SSE connection management patterns?
- [ ] How do implementations handle session isolation?
- [ ] What are the performance considerations for multi-tenant scenarios?
- [ ] How is error handling and reconnection managed?

### Client Compatibility
- [ ] What are Claude Code's specific OAuth validation requirements?
- [ ] How do other MCP clients handle authentication?
- [ ] What are the compatibility constraints across different clients?

## Documentation Strategy

**File Structure:**
```
Docs-Research-POCs/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Research_Plan_and_Progress.md (this file)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Current_MCP_Implementations_Research.md (findings)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MCP_SSE_OAuth_Implementation_Guide.md (our discoveries)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [Future files as needed]
```

**Update Pattern:**
1. Add findings to `Current_MCP_Implementations_Research.md`
2. Update progress in this file
3. Create specialized docs for specific topics as needed

## Success Criteria

**Research Complete When:**
- [ ] 10+ implementations analyzed
- [ ] Authentication patterns documented
- [ ] Security recommendations created
- [ ] Gap analysis completed
- [ ] Production deployment guide written

**Immediate Next Steps:**
1. Continue with ory/mcp-sse analysis
2. Update research findings file
3. Progress to next repository in Phase 2 list
